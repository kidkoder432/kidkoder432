Hi!
My name is Prajwal Agrawal. I'm a 13-year-old software developer, but I have't been hired yet. So I'm just some noob on GitHub who likes to code.

People I follow:

- [Sebastian Lague](https://github.com/SebLague)
- [My friend Joshua](https://github.com/ProgrammingParadox)
- [Rishabh Chandra](https://github.com/rishbobb)

My Code Hub: https://kidkoder432.github.io

Languages I use: 
- Python
- JavaScript (sometimes)
- HTML/CSS

I'd like to learn C++, Java, or Unity someday.
I'm also terible at JS, so help is greatly appreciated :heart:
